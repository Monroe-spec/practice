// objects are a const. that has variables put in in a specific catagory, for example, you can put the make, model, color, and year of a car in an object.

//ex

// const car = {
//     make: "Toyota",
//     model: "Corolla",
//     color: "Blue",
//     year: 2004
// }

// use "this." to refer to an object as a whole, such as "this.make" or "this.model".
// That way when you type in the object name, it will refer to the object as a whole, and not just the variable.
